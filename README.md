# CPP_SortingAlgorithm_Templates
Different sorting algorithms templates (optional multithreading) for C++

Feel free to use them :-)

Included algorithms:
  - cycle sort
  - bubble sort
  - bubble sort recursivly
  - shell sort
  - comb sort
  - gnome sort
  - gnome sort with jump to last correct position (insertionsort)
  - radix sort
  - slow radix sort  (without move semantics)
  - radix sort in-place and mixed with insertionsort (multithreading)
  - bogo sort
  - bozo sort
  - selection sort
  - insertion sort
  - insertion sort with binary search
  - odd-even-sort (multithreading)
  - shaker sort
  - quick sort (multithreading)
  - merge sort (multithreading)
  - heap sort 
  - intro sort (multithreading)

This library is used in my other project https://github.com/Kevger/SortVisualization
